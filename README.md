# Genre Discovery: Using Naive Bayes Modeling to Predict Genre

Genre presents a unique classification problem, so this anaylsis strives to use Naive Bayes modeling to predict genre. Genre's unique problem stems from both the fact that genre is often poorly defined and also that multiple genres are often present in the dame work. Thus, a single word can be representation of multiple genres at once.

This analysis uses a dataset created at Carnegie Melon from 16,559 summaries from Wikipedia, combined with Freebase information, like genre, and ISBN. It uses a bag of words approach along with Naive Bayes in order to create a fast model to analyze new pieces of text.
